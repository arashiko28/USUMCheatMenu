# Pokémon UltraSun & UltraMoon Cheat Plugin

- Illegal Cheats [NOT WORKING]
  1. Catch Trial Pokémon

  3. Pokémon can learn any TM

Previously I had removed any codes that could make illegal Pokémon that could not be traded or battled online. I have decided to add these codes in but with a large disclaimer. The Spawner code can make legal Pokémon if attention is taken to location, level, and form of spawned Pokémon.

This is a work in progress and a learning exercise. The GateShark cheats these codes were derived from can be found in the resources folder.
