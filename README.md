# Pokémon UltraSun & UltraMoon Cheat Plugin
## A cheats plugin for NTR CFW

Plugin created off @AnalogMan151's ntr plugin for S/M. I just changed the codes for them to work on USUM.

[Plugin shoud build good, if there is any error contact me.]

### Cheats include:

To see current cheats working, read the gbatemp thread:

Previously I had removed any codes that could make illegal Pokémon that could not be traded or battled online. I have decided to add these codes in but with a large disclaimer. The Spawner code can make legal Pokémon if attention is taken to location, level, and form of spawned Pokémon.

This is a work in progress and a learning exercise. The GateShark cheats these codes were derived from can be found in the resources folder.

### To build it you will need:
1. Devkit
2. Python 2.7
